# FeynmanCompiler
Convert feynman diagrams into machine code ,Graph objects ,and generate AST of a given diagram

This code is a function that takes in a diagram and returns the corresponding machine code.The compile function initializes the properties of the particles in the diagram and then iterates over the vertices and arrows in the diagram to generate the appropriate machine code instructions. The optimize function takes the generated code and applies advanced optimization techniques to improve its performance. The execute function takes the generated machine code and simulates its execution, printing the resulting particles to the console if the verbose flag is set to True.
